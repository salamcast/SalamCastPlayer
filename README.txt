My old HolzCast Podcast Player is now SalamCast Player...

I'm sure you're wondering what's the difference?

Well the HolzCast podcast player is a javascript/jQuery only plugin that just delt with the RSS format,
all feeds had to be local files or localdomain resources; SalamCast Podcast Player uses PHP to download podcasts
from a remote server so content can be played on your web server and the jQuery Plugin will parse the podcast
XML namespace, and will eventually have ATOM XML namespace support.


The Demo will have some podcast configured to show you how it works with feeds you have no control over.

I have added a few supprise podcast heardoc configs in the code, check it out to find other podcast selections
that you can play.  Search through iTunes for more podcast to play.
